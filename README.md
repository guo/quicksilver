# Quicksilver: A Simple Agent Framework with LLM, Tools, and Memory
This project provides a foundational framework for building intelligent agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), custom tools, and memory capabilities.

# Key Concepts
LLM (Large Language Model): An interface representing the LLM interaction. (Replace with your actual LLM integration)
Tools: Custom modules for specific functionalities (e.g., API calls)
Memory: A component for storing and retrieving conversation history or context.
Workflow: The core logic that orchestrates interaction between LLM, tools, and memory.
Agent: The main class that uses the workflow to handle user requests.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/quicksilver.git
Install dependencies: npm install
(Optional) Replace DummyLLM with your actual LLM integration in src/llm.ts
Create custom tools in the src/tools directory (refer to api_tool.ts for an example)
Run the agent: npm start (or node src/index.ts)
Running the Example
The provided index.ts demonstrates a basic usage with a dummy LLM and a simple API tool for weather information.

# Next Steps
Integrate a real LLM (e.g., OpenAI API)
Implement more sophisticated memory types (e.g., conversation buffer, vector store)
Develop more custom tools for specific functionalities
Improve the workflow logic for better decision-making
This framework provides a starting point for building intelligent agents with LLMs. Feel free to extend and customize it to suit your specific needs.
